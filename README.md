# Weather-App

This application was generated using CSS, Java Script and HTML.

The purpose of this project was to allow users to access the current weather and also the 5 day forcast for a specific city. This application allowed me to practice pulling third party API data for the first time and I made sure to practice pulling data as much as possible (hence why most of the data is pulled statically).
